The Charg Coin (CHG) Repository is mostly private at this time.  You can keep see snapshots of the repo here: https://forum.chgcoin.org/t/yes-we-do-have-a-healthy-github/145  Feel free to ping us to ask for an update of the screenshot, we forget there are humans outside of our darkened basement windows when we are too busy coding!
